# Getting Started

The DoccFramework is generated using Apple's DocC Documentation. 

## Overview

In order to generate such a documentation, it is a good practice to read the documentation from Apple on how to do this. You can find the documentation 
[here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-supplemental-content-to-a-documentation-catalog).

There are a lot of things you can do with this documentation. It supports [interactive tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc/tutorials) as well as [articles](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-supplemental-content-to-a-documentation-catalog) and a lot more; 
this page is an example of an artcile.

### Start saying hi
In order to use the framework, import it and call the DummyClass sayHi method. More details will be added here.
